#### Side Notes

This module came up as a mixture of two sessions IÂ´ve seen at the PowerShell + Devops Global Summit in 2024.

[Justin Grote](https://github.com/JustinGrote) introduces in his session how FeedbackProvider in PowerShell works and he showed his ScriptFeedBackProvider Module.

[Dave Caroll](https://thedavecarroll.com/) did a session about cross platform script integration.
